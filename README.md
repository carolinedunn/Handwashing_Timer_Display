Due to the global pandemic, I see both useful and funny COVID-19 hacks invented everywhere. I thought I would jump in and make my own COVID life hack with a hand washing timer that is motion triggered and plays a 20-second music clip. Why 20 seconds? Health officials are recommending that we wash our hands often and for at least 20 seconds each time. When I reach for my soap, I would trigger this handwashing timer to play a music clip and the display will countdown for 20-seconds.
